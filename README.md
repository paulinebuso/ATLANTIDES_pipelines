# ATLANTIDES_pipeline

This document gathers all my BASH and R scripts that I created and used during my master 2 project: Investigate the genetic effect of parallel domestication of Atlantic Salmon in Europe and North America: a genome-wide scan for selection signatures

Comments are written for problems I encountered or interesting things to know about the bioinformatics analyses.

Two mains objectives : 
- define the genetic structure of each population
- highligh genes under selection in farmed population by 3 methods : Tajima's D (site-frequency based method), FST (population differenciation), XP-EHH (haplotype differenciation based method)
